# mTICS
Derivation of the mTICS score in ELSA (separate waves datasets)

The STATA do file provides steps into the derivation of the following main variables:
* The mTICS27 continuous score (based on the HRS study method)
* The categorisation of the mTICS27 score based on the value cutoffs for low, moderate and normal cognition
* The cognitive level based on a combination of mTICS27 score and report of dementia or AD diagnosis
* A complete mTICS27 score with a logic for recoding the missing data based on the incomplete mTICS27 score
